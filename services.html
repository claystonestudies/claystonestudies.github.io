            <p>I offer personal tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom. Here are the general categories of personal sessions that I offer, although these categories are not exhaustive. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) General tutoring or coaching. </b> This session category is for tutoring or coaching topics not listed below, but which you are interested in working on with me. Perhaps I discussed a unique topic in one of my YouTube videos that interested you, but is not listed below. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(2) Self-improvement coaching. </b> Self-improvement is an interest of mine and something I seek to practice; in this type of coaching session, I offer help for your own path of self-improvement, whatever that path looks like for you. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(3) Writing tutoring. </b> My approach is to focus on bringing your intuition and imagination into action. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(4) Dialectical method conversation. </b> We explore a topic of your choice (in philosophy or other area) using the dialectical method, also known as the Socratic method, which here means using questions and answers, back and forth, to go deeper into the topic and gain more understanding. I intend for the method to be natural, adaptive, and intuitive. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(5) Philosophy tutoring. </b> If you would like to work with me on a topic outside of the content I've discussed on YouTube, please send an email to me indicating the topic. Once I confirm that I can help you with it, you may book the session.</p> <br>
        <p> Sessions may be purchased singly or in a bundle. You can schedule a day and time directly using the calendar tool below. </p>
