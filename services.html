            <p>I offer personal tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom. Here are the general categories of personal sessions that I offer, although these categories are not exhaustive. </p>
             <p>   (1) Philosophy tutoring.
                (2) Socratic method conversation. We explore a topic of your choice (in philosophy or other area) using the Socratic method, which here means using questiona and answers, back and forth, to go deeper into the topic and gain more understanding.
                (3) Writing tutoring. My approach is to focus on bringing your intuition and imagination into action.
                (4) Self-improvement coaching. Self-improvement is an interest of mine and something I seek to practice; in this type of coaching session, I help you in your own path of self-improvement, whatever that looks like for you.
                (5) Other tutoring or coaching. This session category is for tutoring or coaching topics not listed above, but which you are interested in working on in our session. Perhaps I discussed a unique topic in one of my YouTube videos that interested you, but is not listed above. </p>
            </p>
        <p> Sessions may be purchased singly or in a bundle. You can schedule a day and time immediately using the calendar tool. </p>
