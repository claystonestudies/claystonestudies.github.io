            <p>Below are the one-on-one coaching and tutoring sessions that I offer on Zoom.</p>

            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) Life Coaching. </b> One hour session: $200. I help you to improve your life so that you find more unity and vitality. <br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/SYRCAGH292BHE" target="_blank" class="purchase-button">Purchase Life Coaching Session</a></p>

            <p class="numbered"><b>(2) Spiritual Coaching. </b> One hour session: $200. I offer my guidance and insights for your spiritual path and practice. I share from my limited knowledge, limited intuition, and the limited progress I've made on my own path. I seek to help you move toward wisdom and vitality, the same goals I am working toward, as well. I am a teacher and spiritual coach, and also a student and learner; I am not an infallible guru. Like every individual, I have positive and negative qualities and make errors and mistakes from time to time. I affirm (i) that the guru is the principle of knowledge, which is the foundation of both the teacher and student in their interaction, and that (ii) both teacher and student learn from each other. <br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/QB9EW48EGXU6U" target="_blank" class="purchase-button">Purchase Spiritual Coaching Session</a></p>

            <p class="numbered"><b>(3) Philosophy Tutoring and Coaching. </b> One hour session: $200. I work with you on a philosophy topic, helping you to more deeply understand it. In these sessions, I seek to help you attain philosophical wisdom. One optional method in these sessions, depending on your nature and preferences, is to explore the philosophy topic using the dialectical method, also known as the Socratic method, which here means using inquiry and questioning to go deeper into the material and gain more understanding. <br><a href="https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/77NJ3ZZNGDQXY" target="_blank" class="purchase-button">Purchase Philosophy Tutoring and Coaching Session</a></p>


            <p class="numbered"><b>(4) Writing and Language Tutoring. </b> One hour session: $65. This session type encompasses areas such as general writing, creative writing, language, communication, and speech and debate. In my approach, I believe it is good that you rightly activate your intuition and imagination in the activity of writing. This session type is useful for students who wish to improve their reading and writing skills. <br> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ncp/payment/H9P9VTASLE3CL" target="_blank" class="purchase-button">Purchase Writing and Language Tutoring Session</a></p>
