            <p>Claystone Studies offers one-on-one tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom video or Zoom audio. (You may select video or audio when you book the session.) Below are the one-on-one session types currently offered. All sessions are presently with Robert Davis.  </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) Spiritual Coaching. </b> Robert offers his guidance and insights for your spiritual path and practice. He shares from his limited knowledge, limited intuition, and the limited progress he has made on his own path. Robert seeks to help his clients move toward wisdom and vitality, the same goals he is working toward, as well. Robert is a teacher and spiritual coach, and also a student and learner; he is not an infallible guru. Like every individual, he has positive and negative qualities and makes errors and mistakes from time to time. He is working to improve on his particular path. Robert affirms that the guru is the principle of knowledge, which is the foundation of both the teacher and student in their interaction, and that both teacher and student learn from each other. (Session packages may be booked <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/catalog.php?owner=34423664&category=Spirituality" target="_blank">here</a>.) <br> <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34423664&appointmentType=category:Spirituality" target="_blank" class="acuity-embed-button" style="background: #000000; color: #fff; padding: 8px 12px; border: 0px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;-moz-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;border-radius: 4px; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block;">Book Spiritual Coaching Session</a>

                <p class="numbered"><b>(2) Philosophy Tutoring. </b> Robert works with you on a philosophy topic, helping you to more deeply understand it. In these sessions, Robert seeks to help his clients attain philosophical wisdom. One optional method in these sessions, depending on the nature and preferences of the client, is to explore the philosophy topic using the dialectical method, also known as the Socratic method, which here means using inquiry and questioning to go deeper into the material and gain more understanding.
