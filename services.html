            <p>I offer personal tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom. Here are the general categories of personal sessions that I offer, although these categories are not exhaustive. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) General tutoring or coaching. </b> This session category is for tutoring or coaching topics not listed below, but which you are interested in working on with me. Perhaps I discussed a unique topic in one of my YouTube videos that interested you, but is not listed below. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(2) Socratic method conversation.</b> We explore a topic of your choice (in philosophy or other area) using the Socratic method, which here means using questions and answers, back and forth, to go deeper into the topic and gain more understanding. I intend for the method to be natural, adaptive, and intuitive. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(3) Writing tutoring. </b> My approach is to focus on bringing your intuition and imagination into action. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(4) Self-improvement coaching. </b> Self-improvement is an interest of mine and something I seek to practice; in this type of coaching session, I offer help for your own path of self-improvement, whatever that path looks like for you. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(5) Philosophy tutoring.</b>As for everyone, there are some areas in philosophy I don't know. Before booking this type of session, please send me an email with your intended philosophy topic. Once I confirm, you may book the session.</p> <br>
        <p> Sessions may be purchased singly or in a bundle. You can schedule a day and time directly using the calendar tool below. </p>
