            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>Claystone Studies offers one-on-one tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom. Here are the general categories of sessions presently offered. There is topic flexibility. All one-on-one sessions are currently with Robert. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) Spiritual Coaching. </b> Robert offers his guidance and insights for your spiritual path and practice. It may be noted that Robert is a teacher and spiritual coach, but not an infallible guru: like every human individual, he has his positive and negative qualities, and is working on his own path, too. Robert seeks to help individuals attain spiritual independence and autonomy, the same goal he is working toward, as well. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(2) General Self-Improvement Coaching. </b> In this type of coaching session, Robert offers help for your path of self-improvement, which may not be characterized as spiritual in nature. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(3) Writing Tutoring. </b> The approach of these sessions is to focus on bringing your intuition and imagination into action. Writing begins from thinking: by improving the quality of your intuition, imagination, and thinking, the quality of your writing is likely to improve. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(4) Dialectical Method Conversation. </b> A topic of your choice is explored using the dialectical method, also known as the Socratic method, which here means using questions and answers, back and forth, to go deeper into the topic and gain more understanding. The method as practiced in these sessions is natural, adaptive, and intuitive. </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(5) Philosophy Tutoring. </b> Robert works with you on a philosophy topic, helping you to more deeply understand it. If you would like to work on a topic outside of the general range of content discussed on YouTube, please first send an email to Robert indicating the desired topic. He can confirm whether the topic is within his field of knowledge in philosophy.</p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(6) General Tutoring or Coaching Session. </b> This session category is for tutoring or coaching topics not listed above, but which you are interested in working on with Robert. Perhaps he discussed a unique topic in one of the YouTube videos that interested you, but is not listed below. </p> <br>

        <p> You may pay for <a href="single-session.html">single sessions</a> or <a href="session-bundle.html">sessions in a bundle</a> with a discount.</p>
