            <p>Claystone Studies offers one-on-one tutoring and coaching sessions over Zoom or phone call. (You may select the session type when you book the session.) Below are the general categories of sessions presently offered. All one-on-one sessions are currently with Robert Davis. For spiritual coaching sessions, four-session and eight-session reservations are available.  </p>
            <p class="numbered"><b>(1) Spiritual Coaching. </b> Robert offers his guidance and insights for your spiritual path and practice. It may be noted that Robert is a teacher and spiritual coach, but not an infallible guru: like every human individual, he has positive and negative qualities, strengths and weaknesses, and is working on a path of his own. Packages of one-hour spiritual coaching sessions are available to be booked <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/catalog.php?owner=34423664&category=Spirituality" target="_blank">here</a>. <br> <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34423664&appointmentType=category:Spirituality" target="_blank" class="acuity-embed-button" style="background: #000000; color: #fff; padding: 8px 12px; border: 0px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;-moz-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;border-radius: 4px; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block;">Book Spiritual Coaching Session</a>

            <p class="numbered"><b>(2) Energy Healing.</b> Robert works with you to identify and address soul blocks, and then offers a healing in conjunction with crystals, intended to promote your journey to full spiritual vitality. The reality of energy healing is indicated by the three premises that (i) all things trace to energy, (ii) our thoughts therefore are composed of energy, and that therefore, (iii) our intentions of healing have real effect in space and time. Relevant is here is the principle in physics and quantum physics, signified in the famous equation e = mc^2, that energy is convertible with matter, or similarly, that particles are convertible with waves. This view in physics has already been around for a century; energy healing is simply one practical implication of this aspect of physics. <br> <a href="https://app.acuityscheduling.com/schedule.php?owner=34423664&appointmentType=72915897" target="_blank" class="acuity-embed-button" style="background: #000000; color: #fff; padding: 8px 12px; border: 0px; -webkit-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;-moz-box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;box-shadow: 0 -2px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15) inset;border-radius: 4px; text-decoration: none; display: inline-block;">Book Energy Healing Session</a>
